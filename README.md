# TikTok Excel DataViz — Trending & Performance Analysis

## Why this project
I wanted a simple but solid Excel workbook that helps understand what usually drives performance on TikTok: views, likes, comments, shares, engagement, and how these metrics behave across different samples (trending, collected videos, liked videos, hashtags).

## What’s inside
**Excel workbook (`/excel/`)**
- Clean tables and structured sheets
- Pivot Tables to explore trends and top performers
- Charts (including scatter plots) to visualize relationships between metrics
- A TreeMap view to compare categories/accounts visually
- KPI tables: views, likes, comments, shares, engagement rate

**Datasets (`/data/`)**
- `trending_videos.csv`
- `trending_authors.csv`
- `tiktok_collected_videos.csv`
- `tiktok_collected_liked_videos.csv`
- `tiktok_funny_hashtag_videos.csv`

## What I did (quick overview)
- Organized the raw data into analysis-ready tables
- Built Pivot Tables for quick slicing (by author, category, verification status, etc.)
- Checked correlations (ex: views vs likes, engagement vs shares)
- Built a few visual pages to make patterns easy to spot


## How to use
1. Open the Excel file in `/excel/`
2. Start with the dashboard/summary sheets
3. Use Pivot filters to explore specific segments (authors, categories, etc.)
